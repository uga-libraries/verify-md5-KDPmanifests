## hashverify.py
This script parses TXT format file manifests generated by Karen's Directory Printer. It is a basic command line script that prints results directly to the terminal. 
It validates the fixity of the files in the specified directory by generating a new MD5 hash value and comparing it to the hash in the existing manifest.
It also skips over common preservation documentation like Duke Data Accessioner logs and media inventories. 

#Script usage
python /path/to/script /path/to/accession/directory
The manifest file needs to be somewhere in the specified accession directory.

##hashverify_withlog.py
This script functions similarly to hashverify.py. In addition to verifying hash information, it also looks for any discrepancies in the two file lists (the manifest and the current directory contents) and generates a CSV log of the full results. Errors print to the terminal for immediate review.
In addition to logging errors, this script logs current MD5 hash information for every file in the directory so that the CSV can be used for future hash verification.

#Script usage
python /path/to/script /path/to/accession/directory
The manifest file needs to be somewhere in the specified accession directory.
